# VLA2018B

This repository serves as a database for all (primarily Trevor's) work done for Richards et al. 2021: "Probing the Wind Component of Radio Emission in Luminous High-Redshift Quasars".  The structure of the repository is described below.

* ``Bokeh/`` contains notebooks to make all Bokeh plots made along the way: t-SNE2 space, CIV distance with images animated in
* ``DriveImages/`` contains PNGs of all our VLA targets
* ``FITS_Images/`` contains the final FITS images of all our VLA targets and a ``.tgz`` file with all images
* ``ForcedPhotometryImages/`` contains example ``.jpg`` NVSS images from our forced photometry analysis.  Images are broken up into sources with luminosity above the FIRST detection limit and above where the AGN is expected to dominate radio ($L_{1.4}\gtrsim10^{24.45}$W/Hz; Figure 2)
* ``Notebooks/`` should contain all of the useful notebooks that went into the paper.  Although it's possible I forgot to transfer some important ones from my personal machine, so let me know if there's something you can't find.
    * Test

Gordon/Amy -- if there is something you're looking for but still can't easily find in this, let me know.  This ReadMe should mitigate the need for rummaging through the repo for something in the future, so if you find yourself doing that, I'm probably not done organizing (but thought I was).
