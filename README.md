# VLA2018B

This repository serves as a database for all (primarily Trevor's) work done for Richards et al. 2020: "High-z Quasars to the Radio Star Formation Limit".  The structure of the repository is described below.

Gordon/Amy -- if there is something you're looking for but still can't easily find in this, let me know.  This ReadMe should mitigate the need for rummaging through the repo for something in the future, so if you find yourself doing that, I'm probably not done organizing (but thought I was).
